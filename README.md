# GRV-VimixGTK2Emerald-Theme-Light
Another theme styled for **Linux** *Emerald Window Decorator and Themes Manager*, based on [*Vimix GTK Theme*](https://github.com/vinceliuice/vimix-gtk-themes), with lovely light colors always inspired by [*Google Material Design*](https://material.io/) ðŸ’ž ðŸ’• ðŸ’–

You can [find and download it](https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1305931/) from my [*OpenDesktop*](https://www.opendesktop.org) account too, along with [other themes for *Emerald*](https://www.opendesktop.org/u/mitma/), as well as from the [repositories](https://github.com/ChemBioScripting?tab=repositories) of my *GitHub* account.

The desktop wallpaper shown in the following [video preview](https://youtu.be/x8wW0cdEJHc) on my *YouTube* channel is a variant of the logo used for my [*YITA Page*](https://www.facebook.com/ChemBioScripting) on *Facebook*, which also inspired the colors used for this Emerald theme (but you can always change and adapt them to your desktop):

The desktop environment used in the video is a custom Linux Fedora 29 XFCE.
