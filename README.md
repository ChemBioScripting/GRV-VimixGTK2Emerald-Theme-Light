# GRV-VimixGTK2Emerald-Theme-Light
Another theme styled for **Linux** *Emerald Window Decorator and Themes Manager*, based on [*Vimix GTK Theme*](https://github.com/vinceliuice/vimix-gtk-themes), with lovely light colors always inspired by [*Google Material Design*](https://material.io/) ðŸ’ž ðŸ’• ðŸ’–

You can [find and download it](https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1305931/) from my [OpenDesktop](https://www.opendesktop.org) account too, along with [other themes for Emerald](https://www.opendesktop.org/u/mitma/), as well as from the [repositories](https://github.com/ChemBioScripting?tab=repositories) of my GitHub account.

Even the desktop background, shown in the [video](https://youtu.be/x8wW0cdEJHc), has been realized as a variation of the logo used for my [YITA Page](https://www.facebook.com/ChemBioScripting) on Facebook [6].
